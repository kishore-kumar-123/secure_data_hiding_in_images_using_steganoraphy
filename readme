I have created an encrypted image by using steganography

the secret code: This is kishore's secret message :)
the passkey: 123 

Confidential Data Concealment in Images Using Steganography

Overview
This project illustrates **image-based steganography**, a method in which a secret message is embedded within an image at the pixel level. The hidden message can be later extracted using the correct passkey.
 Features
- Conceals a secret message within an image  
- Encrypts the message by altering pixel values  
- Decrypts the message only with the correct passkey  
- Uses **OpenCV** for image manipulation  

Project Structure
Secure_Data_Concealment_In_Images_Using_Steganography
- secure_data_concealment.py  # Main script
-  Image.jpg                  # Original image (for encoding)
-  encryptedImage.jpg         # Encrypted image (output)
-  README.md                  # Documentation

Installation & Setup
1️ Prerequisites
- Install Python (>=3.7)
- Install OpenCV via pip:
  pip install opencv-python
  

2️ Running the Script
1. Place the image you want to use as the carrier (`Image.jpg`) in the project folder.
2. Open a terminal and execute:
   python secure_data_concealment.py
3. Provide the secret message and passkey when prompted.
4. The script will produce `encryptedImage.jpg` with the hidden message.
5. Run the script again and input the correct passkey to extract the message.

How it works

1. Encoding:
   - The script loads an image using OpenCV.
   - Each character of the secret message is converted into pixel values.
   - The pixel values are altered in a **non-sequential** pattern to embed the message.

2. Decoding:
   - If the right passkey is provided, the script reads the pixel values and reconstructs the hidden message.

Limitations
- Best suited for uncompressed image formats (e.g., `.png`, `.bmp`).  
- JPEG compression may modify pixel values and hinder decryption.  
- The message length is restricted by the size of the image.  

Example Usage

Encryption  
Secret Code To Unlock: hello123  
Enter The Passkey: secret12  
The message is successfully concealed within `encryptedImage.jpg`.

Decryption 
Enter passcode for Decryption: secret123  
Decrypted message: hello123  
Message successfully retrieved!

Security Considerations
- The encryption used here is basic and does not employ advanced cryptographic methods.
- For increased security, consider applying AES encryption on the message before embedding it in the image.
